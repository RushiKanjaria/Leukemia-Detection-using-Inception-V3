# Leukemia Detection using Inception-V3
A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or  function of all or part of an organism, and that is not due to any immediate external  injury. In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that  causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or  similar problems for those in contact with the person. Diseases such as Cancer is one  which is having high mortality rate. Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells  grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body causing death. Cancer is very  hard to predict and if not predicted on time can be fatal. 

The technology today is very advanced and fast. Most cancer diseases like breast cancer  can be predicted. Yet there are more of cancers which cannot be predicted at an early  stage or till 3rd or 4th stage of disease, Such as Lung cancer, Colon Cancer, Leukaemia  (Blood Cancer). Here in our project, we are trying to analyse Leukemia a patient is  having by using a medical image. 

In our project “Leukemia Detection using Inception V3” we will be using microscopic images of WBC of the patients having Leukaemia of ALL type. With the help of DL  methodologies, we will analyse the images and use them to train our model which will  eventually predict whether the patient is having ALL, when a new image is given as input  to the model. 

The scope of our project is very general and only for research purpose. Till now we are  just focusing of how to use Deep Learning techniques to analyses an image and further  train a model using images to predict leukemia. On a long-term perspective, we will  surely try to take this project to next level where cancer will be predicted on early stage  and in real time.
